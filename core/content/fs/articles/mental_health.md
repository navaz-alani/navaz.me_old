Mental Health: A List of Helpful Resources
==========================================

The following is a list of resources related to mental health that I have found
to be useful over the past few months. In my experience, many of us have not had
to deal with real mental health issues and this is bad because it has left us
unprepared and vulnerable to ourselves. In this dire time, I compile this list
to help my friends out there who may be feeling lost and overwhelmed with their
own emotions.

You are not alone.
What you are feeling may not seem normal, but it is! You just need the right
tools to deal with this situation.

Anxiety
-------

1. [Anxiety and Your Brain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15b3gllWLLc)
  This video helps one to become more conscious about the information we consume
  in today's world and possible blind-spots that we tend to ignore. Additionally,
  it helps understand our own reactions to such stimuli and be more mindful of
  what we feel, allowing us to take a more objective stand point and get in
  control of our own thought processes (Context: COVID-19).

2. [Neuroplasticity and the Anxiety Cycle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTuX_ShUrw0)
  This video explains the anxiety cycle and how the neuroplastic property of the
  brain can actually reinforce anxiety and make it a part of your life. This is
  important to understand because many of us may actually be stuck in this
  cycle, without even knowing it. As a result, our brain could actually be
  rewiring itself to be more anxious. The video also provides ways that one can
  intervene in this cycle.

TLDRs
-----

The following is a collection of quotations which nicely summarize some of the
takeaways from the resources in this document.


- From Anxiety-1 (1st link in Anxiety Section)
  - "God, Grant me the **serenity** to accept the things that I cannot change,
  **courage** to change the things I can and **wisdom** to know the difference."
  - "He who has a 'why' to live for can bear almost any 'how'."
